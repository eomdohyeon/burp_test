# Video evidence of delays due to burp suite update

This issue has been confirmed on Mac (Intel) and Windows versions (I suspect it may be the same on other platforms, but I haven't checked).

This symptom was installed and tested based on the Community Edition, which provides only the minimum functions, and we inform you that the same symptom occurs in the Pro version.
